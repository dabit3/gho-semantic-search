GhoDiscountRateStrategy
This contract implements the calculation of the discount rate depending on the current strategy.

The GhoDiscountRateStrategy contract inherits the IGhoDiscountRateStrategy interface.

This page shows the public constant state variables, and external pure methods within the GhoDiscountRateStrategy contract. The source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/src/contracts/facilitators/flashMinter/GhoFlashMinter.sol

DEBT AND DISCOUNT TOKEN
Debt Token = GHO, the discounted token Discount Token = stkAAVE, per the initial design OR current configuration

Constant State Variables
GHO_DISCOUNTED_PER_DISCOUNT_TOKEN
uint256 public constant GHO_DISCOUNTED_PER_DISCOUNT_TOKEN = 100e18

The amount of debt that is entitled to get a discount per unit of discount token (stkAAVE).

Expressed with the number of decimals of the discounted token (GHO).

DISCOUNT_RATE
uint256 public constant DISCOUNT_RATE = 2000

The percentage of discount to apply to the part of the debt that is entitled to get a discount.

Expressed in bps. For example, a value of 2000 results in 20.00%.

MIN_DISCOUNT_TOKEN_BALANCE
uint256 public constant MIN_DISCOUNT_TOKEN_BALANCE = 1e18

The minimum balance amount of discount token (stkAAVE) a user must hold to be entitled to a discount.

Expressed with the number of decimals of the discount token (stkAAVE).

MIN_DEBT_TOKEN_BALANCE
uint256 public constant MIN_DEBT_TOKEN_BALANCE = 1e18

Minimum balance amount of debt token (variableEthDebtGHO) to be entitled to a discount.

Expressed with the number of decimals of the debt token (GHO).

Pure Methods
calculateDiscountRate
function calculateDiscountRate(uint256 debtBalance, uint256 discountTokenBalance)
    external
    pure
    override
    returns (uint256)

Calculates the discount rate depending on the debt token (GHO) and discount token (stkAAVE) balances.

The debtBalance and discountTokenBalance must be above the MIN_DEBT_TOKEN_BALANCE and MIN_DISCOUNT_TOKEN_BALANCE` respectively, to receive a discount.

Please see the Discount Rate page for more information and examples of the discount rate implementation.
